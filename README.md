### Project Overview
I developed a full stack E-Commerce website utilizing React.js for the front-end, and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the back-end. This platform enables a vendor to showcase and sell her crochet collection online, with a fully integrated system for managing products, handling orders, and processing customer interactions.

### Front-End
React.js: Implemented a responsive and dynamic user interface that includes product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication (login/registration). The UI efficiently handles user interactions and displays data fetched from the back-end APIs.

### Back-End
- Node.js & Express: Built the server-side architecture, handling API requests for CRUD operations on products, user authentication, and cart management.
MongoDB: Utilized MongoDB as the database to store product information, user data, and order details. The database schema was designed to efficiently manage relational data between products, users, and orders.
- APIs: Created RESTful APIs to enable seamless communication between the front-end and back-end, allowing for operations like adding, updating, and deleting products, as well as managing cart items and user authentication.

### Admin Panel
Developed an admin interface for managing the product catalog, including the ability to add new products, update existing ones, and manage cart items. The admin panel also includes user authentication features to secure access.

### Future Enhancements
Stripe Integration: Planned implementation of a payment module using Stripe to enable secure and reliable payment processing on the platform.
